## The Concept
### An interactive GUI application for studying American-geography-themed flashcard sets (refers to the Americas, not the United States!). 
### The user is initially presented with a menu from which they are given the ability to choose out of a selection of flashcard sets including: North American countries, North American flags, South American countries, South American flags, and Carribean nations. Upon selection they are directed to study the flashcard set of their choice. Each flashcard provides a picture, be it of a country outlined on a map or a national flag. The user's challenge is to deduce the correct country from the image content and provide it in the input box below. The user's progress throughout the set is tracked, and each flashcard provides a count of the cards the user has yet to solve, those that have so far been solved correctly, and those that so far have not. Upon full completion of the set the user's final score is presented followed by an answer key for corrective learning. At any point in time the user is given the option to momentarily pass up on a card or return to the main menu for reselection.
## Features
### GUI - A GUI is constructed using Python's Tkinter library. Python's Pillow library is used for imaging.
### PSEUDORANDOM - The sequences in which flashcards in a set are presented are pseudorandomly generated using Python's Random Module's randint() method. 
### DYNAMIC - Upon response submission, users are immediately notified whether or not their response was correct. If correct, progression to the next slide is postponed for 600 milliseconds while a "Correct!" message is printed to the screen in green. If wrong, progression to the next slide is postponed 1000ms while a "Wrong!" message is printed in red followed by the correct response. User's progression and performance on a set is tracked and updated on-screen.
### BINDED RETURN KEY - In addition to the on-screen 'Enter' button, users have the ability to submit their responses via the 'Return' button on their keyboard, which allows for faster study sessions.
